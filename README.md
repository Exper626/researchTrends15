# **Social Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data**

This project focuses on **analyzing public sentiment on Twitter** using both traditional rule-based approaches and modern transformer-based models. We experiment with a **range of NLP models**, starting from lexicon- and rule-based methods to fine-tuned transformer architectures (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.) for text sentiment classification.

Additionally, we aim to explore **multimodal approaches** by integrating **vision transformers (ViT)** for images in tweets, requiring combined text and image datasets. The project includes:

* Data collection and preprocessing from Twitter APIs
* Baseline rule-based sentiment systems
* Transformer-based NLP models for sentiment classification
* Vision transformer experiments for multimodal sentiment analysis
* Evaluation metrics, visualization, and insights from the analysis

This repository contains **code, datasets, and notebooks** for reproducing experiments, along with detailed documentation and results.
